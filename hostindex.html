  <h1>Warning</h1>
  <pre align="left">
A defacement is considered in all countries an unauthorized computer access, a denial of service action therefore a CRIME under all means, even if you don't think so.
The activity of defacing to warn the administrator of a bugged server about its vulnerable status is considered a crime too and a questionable ethical conduct.
Zone-H accepts your notifications but doesn't support, condone, justify at all any defacing activity. Instead, we welcome you to stop such activity or else you might
face the same destiny of some notorious defacers who got arrested and jailed. See the following examples:

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/27/secfocus_hacker_deport/page2.html
http://www.zone-h.org/content/view/4446/31

You might want to consider instead, the possibility to quit your ILLEGAL activity before getting jailed (because you will) as other defacers did before you. See this example:

If you have any question or if you need any help or advice to convince you about all of the above, feel free to contact any of the Zone-H staff members.
